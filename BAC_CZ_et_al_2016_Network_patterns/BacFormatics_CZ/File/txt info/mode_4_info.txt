The 'Merge Cells' mode allows the user to merge selected segemnts. 
Mouse right click on a pointed cell to select or un-select cells.
Pixels belong to the selected cells are marked in yellow crosses.
When a cell is un-selected the yellow crosses will disapear for that cell.
Mouse left click apply a merge between the selected cells.
The merge is done by closing the gap between the yellow marked pixels.
The User has to define the morphological structuring element (strel) that control the closing opperation.
If the strel is smaller than the gap, the gap cannot be close.
If the strel is much larger, there  will be over-estimation of the cells border.
Choose the strel carefully.
